        ----------
        adv : `numpy.ndarray`
            The original, unperturbed input as a `numpy.ndarray`.
        annotation : int
            The reference label of the original input.
        unpack : bool
            If true, returns the adversarial input, otherwise returns
            the Adversarial object.
        abort_early : bool
            If true, returns when got first adversarial, otherwise
            returns when all the iterations are finished.
        epsilons : int or Iterable[float]
            Either Iterable of standard deviations of the salt and pepper
            or number of standard deviations between 0 and 1 that should
            be tried.
        repetitions : int
            Specifies how often the attack will be repeated.
